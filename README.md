# Climate-Data-App

Feature  Set
 
A software supports as many of the following features: 

A. List all the recording locations for which you have data 
B. List all weather observations for a specified location, in chronological order 
C. List weather observations for a specified month / year across all recorded locations 
D. Find the minimum and maximum recorded temperatures for a specified location along with when

- Designed a UML Class Diagram to describe the customised types with some 
brief explanatory text to explain how file data is parsed.

- Explained how solutions to the stated  Features can be facilitated with linear/exhaustive search and 
simple sorting algorithms using UML activity diagrams

- Evaluated the algorithmic time complexity of the exhaustive solution for each feature
